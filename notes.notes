----------- LOOK UP -------------
- assessment study guide
  - why isn't `String.fromCharCode` a function?
- uncaught vs caught error?
- # are array indexes also properties?
- is `arr[1]` and `arr[1] = 5` and `obj['a']` considered a method or operator?
  - (square bracket notation)
- "computed elem operator"?
- creation/execution phase in global/function context (hoisting)
- difference b/w Array(4) and Array(4).fill() (undefined's)



----------- STUDY MORE -----------
- chrome devtools video and articles:
  - "https://launchschool.com/lessons/56df7843/assignments/0c65c1ca"
  - # practice debugger more!
- hoisting details
- function expressions

=====
- primitive values, types and type conversions
- variable scopes and hoisting
- function declarations, expressions and scopes
- object properties and mutation
- assignments and comparison
- pure functions and side effects
=====

- *return value* of an <expression>
- whether there are *side effects* (ex: mutation)
- whether *new objects* are <created>
- or whether something is being *output*

=====

- explain *why* something happens:
  - using precise vocab
  - pinpoint the exact *causal mechanism* at work
- explain *how* code works

=====

- explain a <concept>
- <analyze> code
- describe <what's happening>

ex:
  [js]
          var a = "hello";

          function foo() {
            console.log(a);
          }

          foo();
  [end]
  - when the function is executed, the variable `a` inside the `foo` function is the same as the variable `a` outside of the function based on JavaScript's lexical scoping rules, therefore line 4 logs hello to the console.
    - The function also returns `undefined` since there isn't an explicit return statement.

xx- devtools on test for debuger?
xx-how often to run code? (every line like in ruby?)
  - test things in console like irb?
advantages to JS over ruby?

single line if else?
blinking chrome cursor?
- use for loop for early return. forEach otherwise...?

custom console log?

const?
