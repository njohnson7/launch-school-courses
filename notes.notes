### More query ideas.

We would like to leave you with some query ideas that you can try out on the library database that we have walked through in this book. In many cases, you may need to insert more data into your tables before you can create these queries.

    Select books that have never been checked out
    Select user that has the most books checked out
    Select users that are most active
    Select users with the most books
    Select users with the most reviews
    Select queries with =, vs in, vs Not IN, vs Like
    SQL queries with wild card search and limit
