numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]

numbers.delete_at(1)
  - This will delete the element at index 1 of the numbers array. So it will
    delete the number 2 from the array. It returns 2, the element it deleted,
    and permanently modifies the numbers array, changing it to [1, 3, 4, 5].

numbers.delete(1)
  - This will delete any elements with a value of 1 from the numbers array, and
    return 1, the value it deleted. It is a destructive method, so the numbers
    array will now contain only [2, 3, 4, 5].
