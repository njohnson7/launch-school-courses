We can omit Kernel because Kernel is a module included by the Object class. Therefore its methods are available to use
in every Ruby object. Since puts and gets are Kernel methods, they are available everywhere, and can be called without
a receiver.


BOOK ANSWER:

When we are writing Ruby code that's not in a class, we're working with an object called main, which is an instance of
Object. The Kernel module is automatically loaded by Object, which gives us access to all of Kernel's methods.
