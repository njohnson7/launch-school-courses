/*
- redundant...?: " procedures or Functions. "
- definition of OOP not very helpful, and kind of contradicts wiki definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
- rephrase:
  - "You call a property whose value assigned to it is a function a method."
  - "You can add methods to an object at any time, as with any other property."
