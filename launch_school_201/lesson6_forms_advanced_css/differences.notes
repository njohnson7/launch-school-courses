I noticed some discrepancies between the three different given solutions for this project (`psd`, `png`, and `html` page):

These were the colors in `psd` file for the `button`:
- `#2e67b2`: normal
- `#6095cb`: `:hover`

These were the colors in the `html` page for the `button`:
- `#0066cc`: normal
- `#5f95cc`: `:hover`

This was the color in example `png` image solution for the `button`:
- `#0861ce`: normal

These were the left border colors (of the middle boxes):
- `#cdcccb`: `psd`
- `#ececec`: `png`
- `#cbcbcb`: `html`

- The `submit` `button` font is bold in the `psd` and `png`, but not in the `html` file.
- Some of the other colors (besides just for the `button`) are slightly different in all three solutions, such as the color of the `input` border.
- The `label`, `input`, and `h2` fonts appear to be a heavier weight in the `png` than in the `html` or `psd`.
- I'm not sure if this was intentional, but in the example solution, the social media account `input`s are not all exactly the same width, and neither are the `password` `input`s.
