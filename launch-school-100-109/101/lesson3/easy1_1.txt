What would you expect the code below to print out?

numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers


I would expect this code to print out:

1
2
2
3

because although number.uniq will return [1, 2, 3], it is a non-destructive
method, so it will return a new array, instead of modifying the original numbers
array. The puts method automatically calls .to_s on its argument, so that's why
each element gets printed out on its own line.
