# Exercise 6

It tells you that your code tried to reference a variable or method called shoes without
  initializing it beforehand. Therefore the variable shoes cannot be referenced because
  it has not yet been  defined within the scope that the code causing the error has been 
  executed in. From the message, we can also see that the error was generated from line
  3 of the irb shell, indicating that the shoes variable was not properly initialized within
  the first 3 lines of the code. It is unlikely to be a scope error in this case.
