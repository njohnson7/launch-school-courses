# Exercise 7


# It tells you that there is a syntax error of the expression you just sent to irb
# Instead of inputting a ')' character, you input a '}' character as the closing bracket
# This could happen when you are creating a hash, which should always be enclosed in curly brackets

# For example, if you were to run the following code in irb, it would give you a similar error
example = {one: 1,
            two: 2,
            three: 3,
            four: 4)
