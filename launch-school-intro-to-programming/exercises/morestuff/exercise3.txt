# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?


Exception handling is a way to tell the Ruby compiler what to do if it runs into an exception, or an error. To incorporate exception
handling into a program, you create a block using the reserved words begin, rescue, and end. You put the code that you think might
cause a problem under the begin block, and you put alternative code under the rescue block. In the case of an error, the code under the
rescue block will be executed and the program will continue executing the rest of its code, instead of terminating immediately and
giving an error message.

Exception handling solves the problem of a single error causing the entire program to stop running.



BOOK ANSWER:

Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program.
It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.

Exception handling is a way to handle errors that come up in your application gracefully, and allows you to take a final action related
to the error, like logging the error or sending an email to notify someone that there was an exception in your application.
Writing a lot of logical code in your exception handling code is very dangerous because you're already in an exceptional state, so it's
best to keep it as concise as possible.
