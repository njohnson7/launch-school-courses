# OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN

=begin

- OOP DESIGN:
  - organizing and modularizing code into a cohesive structure of classes.
  - knowledge of OOP helps us to build better designed applications
  - there are wrong ways to approach OO design, but no official right way
    - only different tradeoffs
      - flexibility vs indirection:
        - the more flexible your code, the more indirection you'll introduce by way of more classes
        - the proper balance will change as your application matures
