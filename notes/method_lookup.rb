# METHOD LOOKUP

=begin

- method lookup path:
  - an ordered list of classes/modules that Ruby traverses to find and invoke a method when that method is called.
- call Module#ancestors on any class to see the method lookup chain
- included modules are inserted above the including class in the chain.
  - reverse order of inclusion.
- modules mixed into superclasses are also included in the lookup path
