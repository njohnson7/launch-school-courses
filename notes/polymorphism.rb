Polymorphism:
  - 'many forms'
  - the ability for messages or methods with the same name to have different behavior
    - depends on what that object is called on
      - ex:
        - including modules to mix in methods
        - inheritance
        - method overriding
        - duck typing

----------------------
- Allows us to use prewritten code for new purposes
