# CLASS VARIABLES

=begin

- 2 @ characters
- info related to an entire class (and descendents)
  - does not pertain to individual objects
- scoped at class level:
  - access from w/i class def or instance/class methods
- only var that can share state b/w objects
- subclasses can override a class variable
- all objects share 1 copy of a class var
-----------------------
- referencing an undefined class var raises a NameError
