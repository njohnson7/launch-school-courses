# ABSTRACTION

=begin

Abstraction:
  - definition:
    - creating classes that represent an object in a simplified way, reducing the object down to only its essentail characteristics and behavior relevant to the problem at hand.

---------------------
- OOP allows programmers to think on a new level of abstraction.
  - Objects are represented as real-world nouns, w/ methods that correspond to their behavior
