# METHOD OVERRIDING

=begin

- defining a method in a class that has the same name as a method further up in method lookup path
  - Ruby will invoke the method in the class, without even checking if it exists in the ancestors
- ACCIDENTAL METHOD OVERRIDING:
  - overriding a method inherited from Object can have far-reaching effects on your code
    - ex - Object#send :
      - a way to call a method by passing it a symbol/string w/ the method name
    - ex - Object#instance_of? :
      - returns true if an object is an instance of passed in class argument
  - Object#to_s is an instance method that can be overriden w/o any major side-effect
    - do this when you want a custom string representation of an object

# ACCIDENTAL METHOD OVERRIDING:

# using Object#object_id for checking if 2 objects are the same object.

# normal behavior:
smart_phone = SmartPhone.new(12345)
another_smart_phone = SmartPhone.new(12345)
smart_phone.object_id                                   # ==> 20502220
# not the same object:
smart_phone.object_id == another_smart_phone.object_id  # ==> false

class SmartPhone
  def object_id
    @imei_number

end

# accidental overridden behavior:
smart_phone.object_id                                   # ==> 12345
# still not the same object, but now it appears like they are:
smart_phone.object_id == another_smart_phone.object_id  # ==> true
