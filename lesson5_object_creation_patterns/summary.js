/*
- no prototype mention in constructor function steps
- shadows: "overwrites " (nothing is overwritten or inherited)
- fix: " be used test "
- the descriptions of prototype pattern and classical pattern are the exact same...
  - prototype pattern would be a better name for OLOO pattern
- " uses a template object" (prototype object maybe better -- factory functions were described as using a template object earlier in course)
