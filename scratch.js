//======================== Assignment: Managing Collections in JavaScript =========================//
- backticks
- code style

- rephrase: "the row of inputs for an item are not on the page, and that we've prepared a template (the <script type="text/template" id="inventory_item"> element) that we can use to add them dynamically on the page later."
- "after you complete this assignment, or need to get help."

- returns `false` from `forEach` for some reason...
- `quantity` is a number to start with, but a string if updated
