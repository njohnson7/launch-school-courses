//======================== Introduction =========================//
- " learned the jQuery library"
- " get in to"
- "array and object iteration"

//========================  Read: jQuery Animations =========================//
- dots and parens in method names in prose
- `++`
- snake case
- keyword-spacing
- `$p` is not a jQuery object
- backticks
- comma-dangle
-----
- is this accurate?: "We used a couple of these effects methods in the first front-end development course. "
- "we can then write "
- " until the next frame equal to the frame length until "
- " All the while, "
- `// `p` has "position: absolute" for this snippet`
- "new-found "
- " get in to"
- "milliseconds,"
- " another could "

//======================== Assignment: Animating a Cartoon Strip =========================//
- backticks -- ex: "for loop", each, blind, div, speed, delay, top, height, 0, animate, etc (in this and other assignments)
- function keyword-spacing
- dots and parens in function names in prose
- double quoted strings
- no link to completed version
- comment spacing
- same code style issues as last videos
-----
- "all of these"
- "The delay method will need to increase by an additional 1500 with each element, since they have to wait for all previous elements to animate and delay to the next one. We can use the index variable to multiply the delay by, then add the speed to it. T"
- "This method works like a for loop, but gets rid of a lot of the code. "
- why not just use the second argument or `this`, instead of: "so we can use that to grab the specific element from the collection by using the .eq() method on the collection and passing in the index."
- " The argument you receive in the callback is the index of the element, so we can use that to grab the specific element from the collection by using the .eq() method on the collection and passing in the index."
- not covered yet: "try adding data attributes "
- "of the assignment overview and walkthrough of the HTML and CSS creation."
- "Next, we walk through the JavaScript that will animate each blind out in sequence."
- "add a link in to"
- "then the dialog would start to appear"
- "explain why and how "
- capital: " "start over" " (x2+...)
- " finished, so 2 "
- "different value of i"
- rephrase: "When we click "start over" when the dialog is loaded half way, the previous startAnimation() method hasn't finished, so 2 startAnimation() method calls are running at the same time, but with different value of i, so the dialog shows in more than one place. To fix this, we need to end the previous startAnimation() method, before starting it again."
- video uses `on`, but Solution uses `click`
- spaces: `$("a").click(function(e){`
- `//on click "start over"`
- spaces: `startAnimation(1500,250);`
- in the video, this function doesn't take any arguments: `startAnimation(1500,250);`
