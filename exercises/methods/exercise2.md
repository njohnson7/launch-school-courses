# Exercise 2 #


The following expressions evaluate to:

1. x = 2    # assigns the value 2 to a variable named x
      returns 2

2. puts x = 2   # uses puts method on the variable x, which is assigned the value of 2
      prints 2    # it outputs x and x is assigned the value of 2, so it outputs 2
      returns nil     # the puts method does not return any value, it only outputs something
      #

3. p name = "Joe"   # uses p method on the variable name, which is assigned to joe
      prints "Joe"   # the p method is more literal than puts, so it prints out "Joe" including the quotation marks
      returns "Joe"   # wthe p method returns what it prints, as well as just printing it, so it returns "Joe"

4. four = "four"    # assigns the string "four" to a variable named four
        returns "four"

5. print something = "nothing"    # print method outputs a statement without appending any newlines
                                  # outputs variable something, which is assigned value of "nothing"
        prints nothing    # (without a newline, like put would do)
        returns nil     # print has no return value, so => nil is printed on the same line as nothing in irb
