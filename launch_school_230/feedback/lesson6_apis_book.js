//======================== Book: Working with Web APIs =========================//
assignment:
- 'work the examples'
-----------------------------

good points overall:
- really good writing, tone, and consistency in style (ex: backticks, italics, etc.) compared to a lot of the other content.
- very interesting, enjoyable, entertaining (humorous), and informative to read.
- summaries at the end of each chapter are excellent.
- very well organized
- great examples
- the HTTP review chapter is written much better than the HTTP book -- maybe assign relevant chapters to be read during course 170 to help clarify things (ex: URL vs URI)
- this book should be used as an example/guide for how other content should be written
- much more accurate and much less errors
