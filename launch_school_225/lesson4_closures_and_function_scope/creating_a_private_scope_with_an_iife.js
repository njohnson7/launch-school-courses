- function keyword spacing
- may not be necessary to repeat these two lines five times:
  - `// thousands of lines of messy JavaScript code!`
  - `// more messy JavaScript code`

___

- change punctuation: "(Yes, it's true; you will encounter messy code, and you need to learn how to work with it.)"
- the `for` loop logs numbers 0-99 not 1-100: `// here you need to loop through and log numbers 1 to 100` (x4)
- move to top: `var i` (maybe -- might not illustrate point as well) (x4)
- `i++` (x4)
- "We can also pass values into the IIFE as ~~parameters~~ [arguments] during invocation: "
- change word: "We'll return to this pattern in future ***content***."
