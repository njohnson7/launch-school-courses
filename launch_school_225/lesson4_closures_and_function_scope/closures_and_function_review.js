  - should be function declaration vs. named/anonymous function expression
  - semicolon after `hello` declaration

- fix singular/plural: "All functions, "..."It can "
- maybe not a good use of the word "context", since it might be confused with 'execution context' (also, the whole sentence could be rephrased): "It can access any variables that were in scope based on the ***context*** where the function was defined. "
